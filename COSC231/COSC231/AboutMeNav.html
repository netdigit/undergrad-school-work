      <td class="bio">Hello! I'm Kelly Mayhew. I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and 
    am still living there to attend college nearby. The above image is a box full of 
    bees in the back of a car. (Picture taken by me.) My family's trying to keep bees. 
    It hasn't gone very well.</td>

    <tr> <!-- Row 2 -->
      <td class="bio">Right now I'm trying to get through college and figure out what I'm going to do 
    once I graduate. I'm double majoring in Biology and Computer Science, which isn't 
    really helping me decide. So I figure I'll just focus on my coursework and any 
    extracurriculars until I decide. I figure I have time to make up my mind.</td>

      <td class="biotop" rowspan="2"><h2><em>Interests &amp; Hobbies:</em></h2></td>
      <td class="bio">When it comes to interests, I can be pretty whimsical. I tend to enjoy the 
    sciences and activities I can do alone.</td>

    <tr> <!-- Row 4 -->
      <td class="bio"><ul>
      <li>Biking. This is pretty consistent. I like to ride my bike around my neighborhood 
      and nearby parks. In addition to being good exercise, it helps me think.</li>
      <li>Writing. When I have free time (and a good enough idea), I like to write 
      short stories for fun.</li>
      <li>I like puzzle games like <a href="http://www.sudokus.tv/">Sudoku</a>. 
      They're a good way to kill time when waiting for class to start.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome Games.</a> I used to waste so much 
      time on this website in elementary and middle school.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I play violin. I'm not as serious a player as I used to be, but I 
      like to fiddle with it.</li>

    <tr> <!-- Row 5 (Dreams & Goals Start) -->
      <td class="biotop" rowspan="3"><h2><em>Dreams &amp; Goals:</em></h2></td>
      <td class="bio">Right now, my most important goal is to figure out what I want to do after 
    college. It might seem silly or underwhelming, but it matters. Specifically, I'm 
    trying to decide whether or not to aim for graduate school. I really don't want to 
    take that kind of decision lightly.</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr> <!-- Row 6 -->
      <td class="bio">As for more short-term goals, I'm trying to get into a research lab! Assuming 
    all goes well/the professor gets the grant she applied for, I along with two others 
    will be able to join the lab in either the summer or fall semester. In the meantime, 
    we're getting up to speed on the kind of research the lab conducts. It's interesting 
    stuff.</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr> <!-- Row 7 -->
      <td class="bio">As for Computer Science, I'm a member of WiCS, and our project for this semester 
    (Winter 2017) is to build a customized website for 
    <a href="http://www.dropearringsnotbombs.org/home/">Drop Earrings Not Bombs</a>. 
    I hope I'll learn a lot from it, and be able to get some ideas for any personal 
    projects.</td>
